medwav-ai

AI-based statistical bias correction framework for Mediterranean and
adjacent Atlantic wave reanalysis products using deep learning models.

The software implements UNet-style neural networks for bias correction
of significant wave height (SWH) and related wave parameters, with a
focus on long-term climatological consistency and scalable experimentation.
